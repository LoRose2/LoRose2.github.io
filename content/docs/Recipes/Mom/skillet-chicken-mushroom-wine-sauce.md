2 hours | 4 servings

## Ingredients[^1]
– 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

– Salt and pepper, to taste

– 2 tablespoons olive oil

– 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (cremini or button mushrooms)

– 3 cloves garlic, minced

– 1 cup chicken broth

– 1 cup dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc)

– 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

– 1 teaspoon dried thyme

– 1 teaspoon fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

– 1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, for thickening)

– 2 tablespoons heavy cream (optional, for richness)

## Steps

1. Start by seasoning the chicken breasts generously with salt and pepper on both sides—do not be shy here!

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side until they are golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.

1. In the same skillet, throw in the sliced mushrooms. Cook them for about 3-4 minutes until they’re softened and browned. Add the minced garlic and sauté it for another minute until that heavenly smell fills your kitchen.

1. Pour in the chicken broth and white wine, making sure to scrape up all those tasty bits stuck to the bottom of the pan—best part coming right there!

1. Stir in the Dijon mustard and thyme. Let the sauce simmer for about 5-10 minutes, letting those flavors meld together beautifully.

1. (Optional) If you like your sauce a little thicker, go ahead and mix the cornstarch with a bit of water to create a slurry, then stir it into the sauce, cooking for a couple more minutes until it thickens up.

1. (Optional) If you’re feeling indulgent, add in the heavy cream and stir to combine.

1. Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, spoon that luscious sauce over the top, and let it simmer for another minute to soak up all those flavors.

1. Before serving, give it a sprinkle of fresh parsley for that final touch!
