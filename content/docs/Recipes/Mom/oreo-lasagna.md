## Ingredients[^1]

### Crust

- [ ] 48 Oreo cookies finely crushed

- 10 tablespoons salted butter melted

### Cream Cheese Layer

- 12 ounces cream cheese room temperature (1 ½ bricks)

- 3/4 cup powdered sugar

- 8 ounces Cool Whip thawed

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- 6 Oreo cookies finely crushed

### Pudding Layer

- 3 cups half and half or whole milk

- 7.8 ounces (2 3.9-ounce) boxes of instant chocolate pudding

- 6 Oreo cookies finely crushed

### Topping

- 8 ounces Cool Whip Thawed

- 12 Oreo Cookies finely crushed

## Steps

### Crust

1. Mix the Oreo crumbs and melted butter in a large bowl until well combined. Pour the cookie mixture into a 9×13 inch baking dish and press into an even layer to form the crust. Refrigerate the crust while you prepare the cream cheese filling.

1. 48 Oreo cookies, 10 tablespoons salted butter

### Cream Cheese Layer

1. Beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar in a large bowl with a hand or stand mixer until smooth and creamy.

1. 12 ounces cream cheese, ¾ cup powdered sugar

1. Add the Cool Whip and vanilla and beat until well combined. Fold in the crushed Oreos.

1. 8 ounces Cool Whip, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 6 Oreo cookies

1. Spread the cream cheese mixture into an even layer over the Oreo crust. Refrigerate while you prepare the pudding.

### Pudding Layer

1. Whisk the half and half and the pudding mix in a large bowl until the pudding thickens. Fold in the Oreo crumbs.

1. 3 cups half and half or whole milk, 7.8 ounces (2 3.9-ounce) boxes of instant chocolate pudding, 6 Oreo cookies

1. Spread an even layer of the pudding over the cream cheese layer. Refrigerate for 5 minutes.

### Top Layer

1. Spread the Cool Whip over the pudding layer and sprinkle the crushed Oreos over top.

1. 8 ounces Cool Whip, 12 Oreo Cookies

1. Refrigerate for at least four hours to allow the pudding to set before serving.

# Notes

- To Store: Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.

- To Freeze: You can freeze your dessert lasagna for up to 2 months. Let it thaw on the counter and serve semi-frozen.

- To Make in Advance: I do not recommend making this more than 24 hours in advance. The longer it sits, the softer the Oreo crust will become.

## Tips

- Use the whole cookie. There is no need to remove the white cream filling before crushing them. This recipe uses two (2) 14.3 ounce packages of Oreos.

- If you don’t have a food processor (or just don’t feel like taking it out and then cleaning it) you can place the Oreos in a ziplock bag and crush them with a mallet or rolling pin.

- Be sure you chill the lasagna for at least four hours before serving. This allows the layers to set, so you get those nice, clean layers when the lasagna is cut. I like to make this dessert the day before I plan to serve it.

- I sprinkled the top of this lasagna with crushed Oreos. Feel free to add a drizzle of chocolate syrup, some chocolate curls, mini chocolate chips, M&M’s, or your favorite kind of candy.

- I recommend using salted butter in the crust layer as it helps to balance the sweetness; however, unsalted butter can also be used. 

- Ensure the cream cheese is at room temperature before starting. Room-temperature cream cheese is easier to mix with the powdered sugar and Cool Whip and will give you a smooth filling. 

- I like using half and half in the pudding layer as it creates a thicker, richer texture. 

- Ensure you are using instant pudding mix and not the cook-and-serve kind. Disregard the directions on the pudding box and follow the instructions listed in the recipe to make the pudding.
