35 minutes | 6 servings

## Ingredients[^1]

- 1/2 cup oil

- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar

- 1/4 cup soy sauce

- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce

- 1/8 cup lemon juice

- 3/4 cup brown sugar

- 2 Tbsp fresh rosemary

- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard

- 1 tsp ground black pepper

- 2 tsp garlic powder

- 6 chicken breasts or 3.5 lb chicken

## Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in a large ziplock bag.

1. Add chicken to the bag and place the closed ziplock bag in a large bowl and put in the fridge. (The bowl will keep it from making a huge mess in case the bag leaks)

1. Marinade for at least 8 hours or overnight and grill

# Notes

- I do not add any extra salt to my chicken marinade because salt will dry the chicken out. ALWAYS salt the chicken AFTER you grill it to ensure. It will need a good bit of salt after it is done
