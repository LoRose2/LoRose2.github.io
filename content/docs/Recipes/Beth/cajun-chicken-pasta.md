30 minutes | 6 servings

## Ingredients[^1]

- 12 ounces penne pasta
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup diced white onion
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
- 4 large cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon paprika powder
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper**, more or less depending on taste
- 1.5 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite size pieces
- 1 cup parmesan cheese, freshly shredded
- 1 cup heavy cream, or half and half
- 4 oz cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup chicken broth

## Steps

1. Boil 6 cups of water in a large pot over high heat and cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain the pasta, rinse with cold water and set aside.

1. While the pasta is cooking, add the butter, olive oil and onion to a large pot over medium-high heat and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent.

1. Add the red bell pepper, garlic, Cajun seasoning, basil, paprika, ground black pepper, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir to combine and cook for 3 more minutes or until the bell pepper starts to become soft.

1. Add the chicken and stir and cook for another 6 to 8 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.

1. Add the parmesan, heavy cream, cream cheese and chicken broth and stir and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until the sauce starts to thicken and the cream cheese has fully melted.

1. Add the cooked and drained pasta and stir to coat pasta with sauce. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then serve with freshly chopped parsley on top, if desired.

# Notes

- I do not recommend freezing this dish, the cream sauce will separate and become oily once thawed.
