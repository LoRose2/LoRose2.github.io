## Steps

### Preparation

1. Prepare the Brownie Layer

    1. Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×13-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.

    1. Mix Wet Ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth and well combined.

    1. Add Dry Ingredients: Sift in the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir until just combined, being careful not to overmix.

    1. Pour into Pan: Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly.

1. Prepare the Cookie Layer

    1. Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

    1. Add Egg and Vanilla: Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well incorporated.

    1. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined.

    1. Add Chocolate Chips: Fold in the chocolate chips.

1. Assemble and Bake

    1. Layer the Cookie Dough: Drop spoonfuls of the cookie dough over the brownie batter in the pan. Use a spatula to gently spread the cookie dough layer evenly over the brownie layer.

    1. Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. The cookie layer should be golden brown.

    1. Cool: Allow the Chocolate Chip Cookie Brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.
