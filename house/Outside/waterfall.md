- old tubing was shot. It wasn't cut and would pool water in the bottom. When winter came it bust open and was leaking everywhere.
- tape was put on the new tube to help reduce any water that might drip onto the electrical
- when we put the new tubing on, we accidentally broke the waterfall itself since the plastic was old and brittle. new models can be found here. Will want to buy this if the other one is shot

- eventually the goal is to have the waterfall wired directly into the house, rather than having extension cords running in the open and exposed to weather
